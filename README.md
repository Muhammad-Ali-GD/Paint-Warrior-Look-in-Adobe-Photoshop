Paint Warrior Look in Adobe Photoshop

Design

Here, I just designed a red paint on the warrior. If I did it using brush tool to make the paint, it wouldn't have looked that realistic, so I created a new layer. Then, I converted the image to black and white on the new layer. Then, I created an inverted layer mask on that layer. Then, choosing white brush I exposed the parts of the layer mask that I wanted to use as a paint.

To convert the paint to red I used a Hue/Saturation layer from color lookup and converted it to clipping mask and changed the color of the paint. It measn that the color of the paint can be changed to any desired color. To add depth to the paint, I changed the blending mode to pass through to add a realistic effect.
